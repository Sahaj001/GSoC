Hello mentors,
	My name is Sahaj Pratap Singh, a 3rd year student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at National Institute of Technology Silchar, India.
	I want to apply at MBDyn for GSoC 2021, and I think this organization would be best for me. I have keen interest in Physics from an early age. I got little late in finding this orgzanization but I plan to give my best.
	As for the Step 1 : first contact,
		I already had Ubuntu in my Mac. I use dual boot for Ubuntu. I followed the Entry-Test.md file , downloaded MBDyn and compiled it, and also made sure all the required dependecies has been met before compiling.I created an build tree pointing to source code , build and installed it as before. Then I learned the basic syntax for input file from https://www.sky-engin.jp/en/MBDynTutorial and https://www.mbdyn.org/?Documentation___Official_Documentation___Examples. Then I wrote a test case and ran it. It then successfully executed and created some output files. For visualization I used gluplot on .mov output file.
		I used a single dynamic node and gave the node 2m/s on Z-axis, and 3m/s on Y-axis. I gave gravity value of 9.81 in negative Z-axis. As for any difficulties I didn't face any there were some dependencies issues which were easy to tackle.
	
	Please review my work and guide me.I'll be looking forward for your instructions.
